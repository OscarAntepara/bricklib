This example solves a Ax=b system by a geometric multigrid.
To run this benchmark test follow the next steps:
On bricklib directory
$ mkdir build
$ cd build && cmake -DBRICK_GPU_AWARE=ON ..
$ make gmg-cuda
$ cd examples/gmg/nvidia_cuda
$ ./cuda -s 512,512,512 -I 10 -l 6 -n 20 

-s is the domain size per rank. In this case is a 512^3 periodic cubic domain.
-l is the number of levels in the V-cycle.
-I is the number of times that Ax=b is solved to gatther timing statitics as min,avg,max,stdev.
-n number of iterations wehre the solver will stop.

For Perlmutter test, a job script (script_perlmutter.sh) for the 8-nodes test is provided.
